## 🧠 What is Object Detection?

**Object Detection** is a computer vision technique that identifies and localizes multiple objects within an image or video frame. It performs two key tasks:

- 🔍 **Classification** — Determines what the object is (e.g., car, person, dog)
- 📦 **Localization** — Identifies where the object is, using bounding boxes

Object Detection is a critical computer vision technique enabling machines to identify and locate objects in real-world environments. Its integration into diverse industries — including retail, healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation — highlights its versatility and transformative impact.

SmartTek (2024) emphasizes that object detection supports real-time analytics across retail stores, autonomous navigation in self-driving vehicles, plant disease detection in agriculture, PPE monitoring on construction sites, and even performance tracking in sports.

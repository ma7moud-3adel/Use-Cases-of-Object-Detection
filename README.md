# 📦 Object Detection – Overview & Real-World Applications

## 🧠 What is Object Detection?

**Object Detection** is a computer vision technique that both identifies and locates multiple objects within an image or video frame. It combines:

- **Classification** – What is the object?
- **Localization** – Where is the object? (via bounding boxes)

## 🔍 Comparison with Related Techniques

| Technique              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Image Classification**   | Identifies if an object exists in an image (e.g., “cat or not”). |
| **Object Detection**        | Detects and localizes multiple objects in the same image. |
| **Semantic Segmentation**   | Labels every pixel by class (e.g., road, sky, tree). |
| **Instance Segmentation**   | Labels every pixel while distinguishing between object instances. |

## 🎯 Why Object Detection Matters

- Enables real-time decision-making in autonomous systems.
- Automates visual tasks in various industries (manufacturing, defense, urban development).
- Powers smart devices and infrastructure (AR apps, traffic management, surveillance).
- Integral to safety, logistics, and productivity in AI-based systems.

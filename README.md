## 🧠 What is Object Detection?

**Object Detection** is a computer vision technique that identifies and localizes multiple objects within an image or video frame. It performs two key tasks:

- 🔍 **Classification** — Determines what the object is (e.g., car, person, dog)
- 📦 **Localization** — Identifies where the object is, using bounding boxes

Object detection forms the foundation of many modern AI systems that rely on visual understanding.

## 🎯 Why Object Detection Matters

Object detection plays a critical role in AI-driven systems because it:

- Enables real-time decision-making in autonomous technologies
- Automates complex visual inspection tasks across industries
- Extracts actionable insights from vast visual datasets
- Serves as a core component in AI, robotics, and smart systems

## 🧠 What is Object Detection?

**Object Detection** is an advanced computer vision technique that simultaneously identifies and localizes multiple objects within an image or video frame. It combines two critical tasks:

- **Classification**: Identifying the type of object (e.g., car, person, dog)
- **Localization**: Precisely determining the object's position using bounding boxes
